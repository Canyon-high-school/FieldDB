					<div class="bulletSection">
						<span>Speakers, linguists, and learners can contribute
							remotely to one centralized database, distributing the
							responsibility of documentation.</span>
						<hr>

							community. Everyone with permission has access to the data,
							ensuring that language information is not just on the computers
							of a few people.</span>
						<hr>
						<span>While it is easy to share data, the database is
							secure and encrypted. Permission settings control who can see
							what.</span>
