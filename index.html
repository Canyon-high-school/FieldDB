<p>FieldDB is a free, modular, open source project developed collectively by field linguists and software developers to make an expandable user-friendly app which can be used to collect, search and share your data, both online and offline. It is fundamentally an app written in 100% Javascript which runs entirely client side, backed by a NoSQL database (we are currently using CouchDB and its offline browser wrapper PouchDB alpha). It has a number of webservices which it connects to in order to allow users to perform tasks which require the internet/cloud (ie, syncing data between devices and users, sharing data publicly, running CPU intensive processes to analyze/extract/search audio/video/text). While the app was designed for "field linguists" it can be used by anyone collecting text data or collecting highly structured data where the fields on each data point require encryption or customization from user to user, and where the schema of the data is expected to evolve over the course of data collection while in the "field."</p>

<p>FieldDB beta was officially launched in English and Spanish on August 1st 2012 in Patzun, Guatemala as an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/lingsync">app for fieldlinguists</a>. </p>

<h1>Formal documentation</h1>
<p>Those seeking traditional formal documenation may be interested in the below resources. However, in general the features of FieldDB are not documented in the formal documenation, as formal documentation in open source projects is almost always out of date and requires effort which doesnt result in direct benefit for users. Instead <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/search?q=export&ref=cmdform&type=Issues">all features must be documented in the feature/issue tracker,</a> and can be found simply by running a search in the feature tracker. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OpenSourceFieldlinguistics/FieldDB/tree/master/tests">All features must also be documented in a  Jasmine Specification ('spec')</a> which is a type of documentation which compiles, and can say whether or not the code meets the specification. Specs are useful both when the code is written, but also over time as a project grows in complexity. A spec is a way of detecting a regression, a loss of features as new features break old ones. Specs and feature trackers are a common low-effort way of documenting a decentralized software project.</p>

<p>However, for those who are interested in an overview of the projet, the formal documentation below can serve as an introduction to the over-arching goals of the project. </p>
<a name="whitepaper"></a>
<h2>White Paper</h2>
<p> The white paper was written in April 2012 and discusses how the project will meet E-MELD and DataOne best practices in data management, as well as some of the modules which were planned and estimates of how much time it would take to build them. The White Paper is perhaps interesting to users, and maybe help users situate the project as compared to similar software. <br/>

<h2>Software Design Description (SDD) </h2>
<p> A Software Design Description IEEE 1016-2009  is a representation of a software design to be used for communicating design information to its stakeholders. It generally contains diagrams which help visualize the software system and maybe most useful for SOEN or CompSci interns, or academics who wish to learn more about they can think like a software engineer (both academic and industry). Note, the SDD is not for users, its very technical. <br/>

<h2>API Documentation (jsdoc) </h2>
<p> If you would like to see the classes/models in FieldDB and how they can interact and be used, you can browse the API documentation which was autogenerated using a tool called 'jsdoc' (documentation generator for JavaScript). Class docs can help software developers/interns who are already know the project understand how to use the source files.  Note, the jsdocs are not for users, they are very concrete and contain code examples. <br/>

<p>These are the webservices which the FieldDB client uses, and which make up the complete FieldDB suite. If you fork the project, you might also be intersted in forking these repositories and adapting them to your needs. We created two scripts to simplify the process of downloading and building the FieldDB dependancies into what we call an fielddbworkspace.</p>
